          <p class="column-content">While attempting to finish a degree in English Literature I took an Intro to Jewelry
            class on a whim to fulfill an elective credit. I loved the class and the professor. Because of that I spent
            more time on that class than any other. The professor suggested I consider metal arts as a new direction to
            take my studies and I agreed. </p>

          <p class="column-content">I started digitally designing for a wedding ring manufacturer in my final year of
            college to help pay for school and a study abroad program. I enjoyed the flexibility that designing within a
            computer program gave me. I wasn't out the cost of metal if my idea didn't work, I could simply adjust the
            program. After graduating that job turned full time because I enjoyed it so much.</p>

        <a class="column-title" href="fluidart.html">Fluid Art</p>
          <p class="column-content">This is where my journey might not seem to match. Jewelry is surprisingly rigid in
            the rules ivolved in getting a piece of jewelry to be wearable. I needed a creative outlet where the final
            result mattered far less than the process. Fluid art caught my attention for those very reasons. It's messy
            with no stict rules and it sure is fun!</p>
